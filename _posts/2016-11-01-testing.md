<p>On this post I'll try to answer some of the questions that I asked myself when writing tests. There are plenty of
information on the internet about what's an unit test, some katas to start with it, etc but there is a big different
between the typical example and production code. You'll find too what's an integration test, or a mock, or what's TDD as
there are enough information out there</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">To mock or not to mock</h2>

<p>So once you're into testing and discover mocks you use them for every class you use as a dependency as we have been told
unit tests can't fail because some external dependency, that this is an integration. In my humble opinion, this is an
error. Mocking should be only used when it's really necessary, when the effort for using the dependency is huge or will
make your test suite slow. I'd include in there external libraries or wrappers of them, database/repositories,
send of emails, writing to a file, etc.</p>

<h4>What are the disadvantages of mocks?</h4>

<p>The main problem is that your test is coupled to the implementation. When you have that feeling that you're writing
the same lines of codes that the real implementation that's coupling. You'll have some calls to your mock with what's
exactly receiving, with how many arguments, what's the return value. It can generate a monster of mock objects</p>

<h4>What's the solution then?</h4>

<p>Apply TDD and avoid creating mocks for you own classes unless that necessary. I have found myself doing this: creating
some class, then writing the tests for it, refactoring this class to extract the logic in some other class. While my
tests are already covering both but I'm mocking now the extracted class, I need to create again some other test for the
extracted class as otherwise no test will execute it.</p>

<p>Of course, the disadvantage of not mocking is the setup of the objects can be really complex too. You have 2
dependencies which at the same time have more and the it grows exponentially. But this is for me a code smell and
remember you're already mocking database, your redis queue, etc</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Unit vs Integration tests</h2>

</a>

<p>Of course you can have the case of the image, some useful unit tests but the application breaking. This is were
integration tests are useful. Some cases are an external library usage like a queue system where you can test a job is
inserted on redis. Generation of payments getting/inserting data into the database using some fixtures in the setUp()
and deleting the rows inserted in the tearDown(). External API calls using a fake server is another example. But don't
use them for increasing the coverage of your code.</p>

<h4>Functional tests</h4>

<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YTzv_O4TnkA/VTgexlumP1I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/57-rnwyvP6g/s1600/image02.png" alt="Test pyramid">

<p>The image from the article <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html"
target="_blank">No more end to end tests</a> describes how I think they should be distributed. It's mentioned a
70/20/10 split: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests. Functional tests or whatever they are
called nowadays are an important part for testing the UI of the application but the cost of maintaining and writing them
is too high. As a developer I think you shouldn't write them. If you're lucky enough to have a QA member in your team
helping, it should be part of his job. They should cover the main functionality and some bugs caused in the past,
that's all.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">How much coverage?</h2>

<p>For me, the aim is 100% and this is where you should point. If you set a minimum limit, let say, 80%, does this mean
that you should only cover 4 of your 5 methods on your class? Specially if you're doing TDD you should have a high
number</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I
would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy,
but not thinking about what they are doing.</p>

-- Martin Fowler
</blockquote>

<p>I usually exclude from the coverage:</p>

<p>Entities, DTOs, Queries and Repositories, specific classes from the framework and the glue between the client and the
backend side like Controllers.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Other important points</h2>

<p></p>

<h4>Law of Demeter</h4>

<p>This is how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" target="_blank">Law of Demeter</a> is
summarized:</p>

<blockquote>
- You can play with yourself.
- You can play with your own toys (but you can't take them apart),
- You can play with toys that were given to you.
- And you can play with toys you've made yourself.
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it says to avoid method chains, to avoid using a getter from an injected object which returns another object
with another getter. Let say User->getCountry()->getCity()->getName(), this is usually solved having a city property
in the User object</p>

<h4>How to test APIs?</h4>

<p>As you want to know if the interaction with the API is working properly but you can't use a production environment for
that, you can build your own API mock server. You can simulate the API behaviour writing some blueprints with for
example <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio" target="_blank">Apiary</a>. With that you'll have a way to test your API
integrations or prototype a new one.</p>

<p>One important thing if you're using internals APIs and not the one of Twitter for example, is that the integration
tests you're writing can be executed for the other teams building these APis which is a fast way to know about breaking
changes or possible bugs.</p>

<h4>What time is it?</h4>

<p>When dealing with tests using some functions time related you can be on trouble if you can't freeze the time. For
that already exists multiple libraries or built in classes that can help you depending of the language/framework you use.
For example, on symfony, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/symfony/phpunit-bridge/blob/master/ClockMock.php"
target="_blank">ClockMock</a>.</p>

<p>This help you to avoid a test failing on a command that can be executed only the first day of the month. Lately
we were having some tests failing in our test suite depending of the timezone they were executed. Try to change your
timezone to something like UTC+5 and execute it to be sure.</p>
